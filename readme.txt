Adds buttons that let your visitors share your content on social media sites.


== Description ==

The Bookmark Me plugin will add buttons that let your visitors share your content on social media sites such as Buzz Up!, Delicious, Digg, Facebook, Mixx, Reddit and StumbleUpon.

Share by Email and Print buttons are also added when the plugin is called within the loop.

Hovering the initial set of buttons will reveal many more services. Only major services are included in the complete list of services. (Two exceptions were made for specialized sites.)

These services are added through the use of widgets. This makes it especially useful for [Semiologic theme](http://www.semiologic.com/software/sem-theme/) users.

Users of other themes can add the following call within the loop instead:

    <php the_bookmark_links(); ?>

The call accepts an optional argument, which sets the widget's title.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
